The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 6.0.0 release. This covers
over 3 months of development work and includes [**572 resolved issues**][1]
from [**77 distinct contributors**][2]. See the Install Page to learn how to
get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 5.0.0 release, Nic Crane, QP Hou, Jiayu Liu, and Matt Topol have been invited to be committers, and Neville Dipale has joined the Project Management Committee (PMC). Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Columnar Format Notes
* A new calendar interval type consisting of Month, Day and Nanoseconds has been added to the specification.  Reference implementations existing in Java, C++ and Python.
## Arrow Flight RPC notes

GLib and Ruby have added bindings for Arrow Flight.

While not part of the release, work is ongoing on Arrow Flight SQL, which defines a protocol for clients to communicate with SQL databases using Arrow Flight. For those interested in the project, please reach out on the [mailing list](https://arrow.apache.org/community/).
## C++ notes

The month-day-nano interval type has been added (ARROW-13628).

Various APIs, including extension types and scalars, are no longer experimental (ARROW-5244).

Support for Visual Studio 2015 was dropped (ARROW-14070).

### Compute Layer

A basic in-memory query engine has been implemented and is accessible from the R bindings. Operations including filter, project, sort, equality joins, and various aggregations are supported.

The following compute functions have been added:

* aggregate functions: `approximate_median`, `count_distinct`, `max`, `min`, `product`
* hash aggregate functions: `hash_all`, `hash_any`, `hash_approximate_median`, `hash_count_distinct`, `hash_distinct`, `hash_max`, `hash_mean`, `hash_min`, `hash_product`, `hash_stdev`, `hash_variance`
* scalar arithmetic functions: `logb`, `round`, `round_to_multiple`
* scalar string functions: `ascii_capitalize`, `ascii_swapcase`, `ascii_title`, `utf8_capitalize`, `utf8_swapcase`, `utf8_title`
* scalar temporal functions: `assume_timezone`, `day_time_interval_between`, `days_between`, `hours_between`, `microseconds_between`, `milliseconds_between`, `minutes_between`, `month_day_nano_interval_between`, `month_interval_between`, `nanoseconds_between`, `quarters_between`, `seconds_between`, `strftime`, `us_week`, `week`, `weeks_between`, `years_between`
* other scalar functions: `choose`, `list_element`
* vector functions: `drop_null`, `select_k_unstable`

In general, type support has been improved for most of the compute functions, but work here is ongoing, particularly around decimal support.

Crashes have been fixed in particular cases for `take`, `filter`, `unique`, and `value_counts` (ARROW-13474, ARROW-13509, ARROW-14129).

Hash aggregations (i.e. group by) supports scalar and array values (ARROW-13737, ARROW-14027).

Temporal functions are now timezone-aware (e.g. when extracting the hour of a timestamp) (ARROW-12980).

`count` can optionally count all values, not just null or non-null values (ARROW-13574).

`fill_null` has been replaced by the more general `coalesce` (ARROW-7179).

`is_null` can optionally consider NaN as null (ARROW-12959).

Sorting has been optimized (ARROW-10898, ARROW-14165). Also, null values can now be sorted at either the beginning or the end (ARROW-12063).

### CSV

The CSV reader can read time32 and time64 types, and will infer time32 values for columns in the format "hh:mm" and "hh:mm:ss" (ARROW-11243).

The decimal point can be customized when reading (ARROW-13421).

The streaming reader will not unintentionally infer null-typed columns when using the various skip options (ARROW-13441).

If a row has an incorrect number of columns, now the row can be skipped instead of raising an error (ARROW-12673).

The option `quoted_strings_can_be_null` applies to all column types now, not just strings (ARROW-13580). When quoting is disabled entirely, the reader now takes advantage of this to improve performance (ARROW-14150).

A CSVWriter object is now exposed, allowing for incremental writing (ARROW-11828). Dates can now be written (ARROW-12540).

### Dataset Layer

The dataset writer was refactored, and now supports more options, including a limit on the number of files open at once, compatibility with the async scanner, a limit on the number of rows written per file, and control over what to do when files already exist in the target directory (ARROW-13650). Additionally, the query engine can feed into the dataset writer as a sink (ARROW-13542).

The asynchronous scanner now properly respects backpressure (ARROW-13611, ARROW-14192), as does the writer (ARROW-14191).

ORC datasets are supported (ARROW-13572) with support for column projection pushdown (ARROW-13797).

The Parquet/IPC format readers now respect the batch_size scanner option (ARROW-14024). Also, the Parquet reader now properly implements readahead for better performance (ARROW-14026).

### IO and Filesystem Layer

The retry strategy of S3FileSystem can be customized (ARROW-13508). When writing to an existing bucket as a user with limited permissions, Arrow will no longer emit a spurious "Access Denied" error (ARROW-13685).

On MacOS with NFS mounts, a "[errno 25] Inappropriate ioctl for device" error was fixed (ARROW-13983). 

The basics of a Google Cloud Storage filesystem have been added; work is in progress for full support (ARROW-8147, ARROW-14222, ARROW-14223, ARROW-14232, ARROW-14236, ARROW-14345, ARROW-14157).

### JSON

A crash was fixed when duplicate keys were present (ARROW-14109). 

### Parquet

Written min/max and null_count statistics for dictionary types were corrected (ARROW-11634, ARROW-12513).
null_count statistics for columns that contain repeated data where corrected.

file_offset for row groups was not being populated according to the specification, this issue has been corrected.

Column selection now works for repeated columns and structs of more then one level.

An error with large files when built with Thrift 0.14 was fixed (ARROW-13655). 

The ParquetVersion enum was updated with more values to support finer-grained Parquet format version selection (ARROW-13794). 

Writer performance was improved by avoiding repeated dynamic casts (ARROW-13965). 

## C# notes

This release includes improved support for dictionary arrays, as well as integration testing with the other Arrow implementations for the primitive and decimal types 

## Go notes

### Version Compatibility Update

* Release process updated to add proper git tags for Go release for Module aware version tracking ([#11312](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/11312)) meaning that this release will be correctly tagged as v6.0.0 in go.mod and pkg.go.dev and future releases will be correctly versioned with the Go module system.

## Java notes

## JavaScript notes

This release fixes builds with the latest TypeScript versions and ESM tree shaking. 

## Python notes
* Many new `pyarrow.compute` functions are available (see the C++ notes above for more details), and introspection of the functions was improved so that they look more like standard Python functions.
* All Python functions and classes should now have documented parameters in the API reference.
* SIMD optimization is now enabled in M1 wheels
* Wheels are now built for more Python versions on M1 systems.
* PyArrow is now compatible with Python 3.10

* Sets are now supported when building arrays or converting from pandas.
* 39 bugs have been fixed.

## R notes

This release adds grouped aggregation and joins in the `dplyr` interface, on top of the new Arrow C++ query engine. There is also support for using `duckdb` to query Arrow datasets. For more details, see the [complete R changelog][4]. 

## Ruby and C GLib notes

### Ruby

### C GLib

## Rust notes

Rust continues to release minor versions every 2 weeks in addition to
a major version with the rest of the Arrow language
implementations. Thus most enhancements have been incrementally
released over the last 3 months as part of the 5.x.

The DataFusion and Ballista sub projects have begun releasing at their
own cadence which is expected to continue in the new few weeks.

Major changes in the 6.0.0 release include support for the `MapArray`
array type, improved lower level `ArrayData` APIs to better
communicate safety, and a faster (but unstable) sorting kernel.

For additional details on the 6.0.0
Rust implementation, please see the [Arrow Rust
CHANGELOG][5]
