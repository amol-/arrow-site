## Rust notes

Rust releases minor versions every 2 weeks in addition to a major
version with the rest of the Arrow language implementations. Thus most
enhancements have been incrementally released over the last 3 months
as part of the 6.x.

Going forward, the Rust implementation version will start deviating
from the rest of the Arrow implementations, incrementing a major
version if the changes to the crate require it. We still plan a
release every other week. Please see issue [#1120](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1120)
for more details

Major changes in the 7.0.0 release include:
1. Additional support for `Decimal`
2. More ergonomic compute kernels that take `dyn Array`
3. `Union` type now follows the latest Arrow standard
4. Support for custom datetime format for inference and parsing CSV files

Another highlight is that the community continues to improve the
safety of the arrow crate. The 6.4.0 release included complete data
validation and has resolved all outstanding RUSTSEC issues against the
crate.

For additional details on the 7.0.0
Rust implementation, please see the [Arrow Rust CHANGELOG][5]
